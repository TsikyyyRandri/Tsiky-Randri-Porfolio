                <h3> Vice President of Administrative Affairs Enactus Umoncton </h3>
                <p>
                    Enactus Umoncton was an association founded by students on campus that aimed to support entrepreneurship among students.
                    Our annual event, “Pitch-Nous Ça,” brought together 24 participants, 4 judges, 3 mentors, 6 business projects, and 1 grand prize winner who
                    walked away with start-up funds. <br>
                    With my Administrative Affairs team, we worked on coordinating activities and planning the event by communicating
                    regularly with the teams and stakeholders. This experience gave me the opportunity to create a structured and collaborative environment
                    through document management, writing summaries, and organizing logistics.

                <h3> Teaching Literacy to children </h3>
                <p>
                    CLEF is a reading support program that pairs volunteers with French-speaking elementary school children to help strengthen their literacy skills.
                    I led and taught educational literacy sessions using PowerPoint and Google Meet. The 45-minute sessions (twice a week)
                    focused mainly on grammar rules, followed by educational games presented in a simple way and adapted to different levels.

                <p>
                    The Maison de Nazareth organizes an annual fundraising event called “Trivthon” to support its activities throughout the year. 
                    I had the opportunity to participate on two occasions. 
                    I was responsible for welcoming participants and briefly explaining the room layout and event flow. 
                    I also contributed to the event logistics, supported the smooth running of the activities (collecting papers, delivering)
                    and assisted with equipment teardown alongside the on-site team.
